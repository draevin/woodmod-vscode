# WoodMod

## Notes

- This theme is evolving and customized to my personal tastes. Feedback and modifications that hold to the general theme are appreciated, so feel free to take a crack at it if you find weird contrasts or rough edges.
- This is my first time creating an extension of any kind, for VS Code or any editor, so I apologize for any poor structure/less-than-best practices.
